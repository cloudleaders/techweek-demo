## Rollback Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Rollback Before Commit

**When to Use**: Workflows generated but not yet committed (Phases 1-3).

**Procedure**:

1. **Delete generated workflow files**:
   ```bash
   rm .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
   ```
2. **Delete state files** (optional):
   - Delete `.cicd-docs/` directory
3. **Log rollback** in audit.md:
   ```markdown
   ## Rollback: Before Commit

   **Timestamp**: 2025-01-28T14:32:15Z
   **Phase**: [Phase where rollback occurred]
   **Reason**: [User requested rollback / Error discovered]
   **Files Removed**: [List of files removed]
   **State**: [Reset / Deleted]
   ```
4. **Inform user**: "Rollback complete. Generated workflows removed. Ready to start fresh."

---

### Scenario 2: Rollback After Phase 4 (After Commit)

**When to Use**: Workflows committed but need to be removed or reverted.

**Procedure**:

1. **Check git status**:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
2. **Revert commit** (if last commit):
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push
   ```
3. **Or delete workflow files and commit**:
   ```bash
   rm .github/workflows/*.yml
   git add .github/workflows/
   git commit -m "ci(workflows): remove generated workflows (rollback)"
   git push
   ```
4. **Delete state files** (optional):
   - Delete `.cicd-docs/` directory
5. **Log rollback** in audit.md:
   ```markdown
   ## Rollback: After Commit

   **Timestamp**: 2025-01-28T14:32:15Z
   **Reason**: [User requested rollback / Error discovered]
   **Commit Reverted**: [Commit hash or "Files deleted"]
   **State**: [Reset / Deleted]
   ```
6. **Inform user**: "Rollback complete. Workflows removed from repository."

---

### Scenario 3: Regeneration (Complete Reset)

**When to Use**: User wants to completely regenerate workflows from scratch.

**Procedure**:

1. **Delete CICD artifacts**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .cicd-docs/
   rm -rf .github/workflows/
   ```
2. **Or use regeneration request**:
   - User requests "regenerate" workflows
   - System automatically deletes `.cicd-docs/` and `.github/workflows/` directories
   - Start fresh from Phase 1
3. **Log regeneration** in new audit.md:
   ```markdown
   ## Regeneration Request

   **Timestamp**: 2025-01-28T14:32:15Z
   **Reason**: [User requested regeneration]
   **Previous State**: [Archived if available]
   **Action**: Deleted .cicd-docs/ and .github/workflows/ directories
   ```
4. **Inform user**: "Regeneration started. All previous workflows and state removed. Starting fresh from Phase 1."

---

### Scenario 4: Partial Rollback (Specific Workflows)

**When to Use**: Only specific workflows need to be removed, not all.

**Procedure**:

1. **Identify workflows to remove**:
   - List specific workflow files (e.g., `ci-cd.yml` or parts of it)
2. **Delete specific files**:
   ```bash
   rm .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
   ```
3. **Update state file**:
   - Remove entries from `generated_files` in `cicd-state.md`
   - Update phase status if needed
4. **Commit changes** (if already committed):
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/
   git commit -m "ci(workflows): remove specific workflows (partial rollback)"
   git push
   ```
5. **Log partial rollback** in audit.md
6. **Inform user**: "Partial rollback complete. Specific workflows removed."

---

### Scenario 5: Rollback Due to Error

**When to Use**: Error occurred and workflows are in invalid state.

**Procedure**:

1. **Assess error severity**:
   - Critical: Delete all generated workflows
   - Minor: Fix specific workflows
2. **For critical errors**:
   - Follow Scenario 1 (Rollback Before Commit) or Scenario 3 (Regeneration)
   - Document error in audit.md
   - Fix underlying issue before regenerating
3. **For minor errors**:
   - Fix specific workflows
   - Re-validate
   - Continue from current phase
4. **Log error and rollback** in audit.md
5. **Inform user**: "Error detected. Rollback performed. [Next steps]"

---

## Rollback Best Practices

1. **Always log rollbacks** in audit.md with timestamp and reason
2. **Inform user immediately** when rollback is performed
3. **Preserve state files** if rollback is temporary (unless user requests complete reset)
4. **Use git revert** when possible (preserves history)
5. **Document rollback reason** for future reference
6. **Ask for confirmation** before destructive rollbacks (deleting all workflows)

---

## Prevention Strategies

To minimize need for rollbacks:

1. **Validate workflows** before committing (Phase 2 linting)
2. **Review thoroughly** in Phase 3 before approval
3. **Use regeneration** for major changes instead of manual edits
4. **Document decisions** in plan files and audit.md

---

## Recovery After Rollback

After performing rollback:

1. **Assess what went wrong** (if applicable)
2. **Fix underlying issues** (if any)
3. **Start fresh** from appropriate phase:
   - Complete rollback: Start from Phase 1
   - Partial rollback: Continue from current phase
   - Regeneration: Start from Phase 1
4. **Learn from rollback** - document patterns to avoid

## Rollback Logging Format

All rollbacks should be logged in `.cicd-docs/audit.md`:

```markdown
## Rollback: [Scenario Name]

**Timestamp**: 2025-01-28T14:32:15Z
**Phase**: [Phase where rollback occurred]
**Reason**: [Why rollback was needed]
**Files Removed**: [List of files/directories removed]
**State Changes**: [What state files were modified]
**User Confirmed**: [Yes/No]
**Next Steps**: [What happens next]

```
